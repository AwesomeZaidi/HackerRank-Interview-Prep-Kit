# Given a matrix, return True if every 0 is reachable from every other zero. Note: the matrix is guaranteed to have at least one zero. Reachable in this case means that you can go from zero A to B

# [[0,0,1],
# [1,0,0],
# [0,0,1]
# -> True

# Loop through the array,s for each item, check if every item has a 0 next to it
